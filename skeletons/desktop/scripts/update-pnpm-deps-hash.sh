# Regenerate flake.nix's pnpmDeps hash after pnpm-lock.yaml changes.
#
# pnpmDeps is a fixed-output derivation: Nix needs its content hash up front, a
# lockfile change invalidates it, and nothing derives it from the lockfile the
# way cargoLock derives Cargo's from Cargo.lock. The factory's desktop-ci.yaml
# runs this on a pull request and pushes the correction, so a dependency bump
# needs nobody to run Nix by hand.
#
# It always builds against a deliberately wrong hash first. A fixed-output path
# is addressed by hash and name, so a store already holding the old hash's path
# skips the fetch and reports success against a stale hash; the wrong hash has
# no path, which forces a real fetch.
#
# A flake that packages no pnpm dependencies (a first stamp's devShell-only
# flake) has nothing to refresh.
#
# Usage: scripts/update-pnpm-deps-hash.sh [--check]
# Exit:  0 correct, updated or absent · 1 stale (--check) · 2 could not run
