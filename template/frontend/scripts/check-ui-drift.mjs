/**
 * Fail when the app hand-rolls something the shared design system already ships.
 *
 * This catches what no other gate can see. A hand-written card compiles,
 * renders, type-checks and passes its tests; it is only wrong once a human
 * opens it on a real display and sees that it does not match the rest of the
 * app. Its sibling gate (check-design-craft.mjs) catches craft defects in what
 * the app DID compose; this one catches the app composing nothing at all where
 * the package ships the answer.
 *
 * `canonical-app-shape.md` makes this gate binding on every full-stack app.
 *
 * FOUR RULES:
 *   1. vendored-copy — a local component whose name matches one @poodle64/ui
 *      ships, and which does not delegate to it; or a `components/ui/`
 *      primitive the package has since shipped.
 *   2. hand-rolled-page-title — a route writing its own title, as an <h1> or
 *      as an <h2> nothing sits above, instead of composing PageHeader.
 *   3. surface-brief-divergence — a route composing a package component its
 *      surface brief does not name. Inert until the app grows
 *      `docs/product/surfaces/`; surface briefs are optional, so an app
 *      without them never sees this rule fire.
 *   4. viewport-variants — the app's count of viewport breakpoint variants
 *      (`hidden md:flex`, `lg:grid-cols-3`) rising above its banked count.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-ui-drift.mjs [--json] [--baseline]
 * Exit:   0 clean · 1 new drift · 2 could not run

// the test, because it does not import the thing it forked.
//

// primitive this app vendored because the package did not ship <name>, and

// The baseline is a debt register, not an amnesty, and it only shrinks:
// `--baseline` drops what has been fixed and banks a fall in the viewport
// count, but never banks a fresh finding or a rise. A finding the app must keep
// is added by hand, a diff a reviewer reads. Only an app with no baseline file

// can compose several undeclared components at once, so keying
// `surface-brief-divergence` the same way collapses them into one entry:
// banking any one silently banks the rest, and a FURTHER divergence on an
// already-flagged page produces no fresh finding at all. That is a fail-open —
// the gate goes quiet exactly when a new divergence lands. Its key therefore
// carries the component name.
